<p class="intro">I watched this film at the weekend which I randomly found. It was a very inspiring, anyone who is even slightly interested in advertising should give this a watch.</p>

<p>I mean, I am no advertiser but to see some of the biggest brands that are around today, such as <em>Apple</em> and <em>Nike</em>, as small companies starting up their advertising campaigns to launch themselves was fascinating!</p>

<p>It was nice to see the people behind the ideas and how they came about them, what they had to say about their thought processes and creativity was inspirational. It really gave me something to think about.</p>
<p>Give it a watch and let me know what you think.</p>
