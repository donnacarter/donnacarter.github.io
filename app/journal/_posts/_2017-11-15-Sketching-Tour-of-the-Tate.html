<p class="intro">
  Earlier this year I became a member of Tate and I discovered that they provide much more than galleries. They provide lots of interesting classes and experiences, the one that caught my eye was a Sketching Tour by Sarah Sparkes.
</p>

<p>
  After a lot of encouragement I decided to sign up - I hadnâ€™t drawn or sketched anything for a very long time. With the modern conveniences of technology, and the speed of which I work, it is rare for me to start a design with pen and paper - normally opting for producing initial concepts on a computer. Feeling somewhat rusty I was nervous about getting out a pencil in front of a group of people and sketching!
</p>

<p>
  On arrival we were handed a sketchbook and some pencils, a large group of us then sat around and introduced ourselves. Everyone was super friendly and almost everyone was in a similar situation to myself: simply wanting to get back into sketching and learn new techniques.
