<p class="intro">Most people will probably already know about this website, but I wanted to share it with you all anyway!</p> 

<p>Working in my new role I have found Kuler really helpful when creating brand ideas and colour schemes. It can sometimes be really hard to come up with a brand new colour palette for a project and I have been having to do this a lot recently! Kuler has been around for a while but I have never really used it. Any way I recommend giving it a go or maybe even contribute your own colour scheme.</p>

<p>They also have a really fun app too called Saturation where you can play around with the colours together.</p>
