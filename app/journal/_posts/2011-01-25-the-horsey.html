<p class="intro">I thought this was quite amazing. I really wish it was possible for me to cycle to work, I would love to have a bike again especially if it looked like this!</p> 

<p>I stumbled upon this really cool idea on the Guardian website by Eungi Kim. The project is part of the Seoul Cycle Design competition, organised by <a href="http://www.designboom.com/eng/">Designboom</a> in collaboration with Seoul Design Foundation.
