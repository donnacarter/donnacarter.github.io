<p>I saw this a while back and forgot to post about it. This is amazing, Coca-Cola have put a vending machine that dispenses free cans of coke in exchange for hugs!</p>

<p>Instead of a Coca-Cola logo across the front it simply says &ldquo;hug me&rdquo; in the iconic red and white which we are all so familiar with.</p>

<p>I would love one of these near me (diet coke obviously). It does not accept money, only hugs. What a way to put a smile on someones face, it certainly made me smile.</p>
