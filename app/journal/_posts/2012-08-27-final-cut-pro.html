<p class="intro">I always love learning how to do new things so when the opportunity came along for me to produce some films for an up-coming project, I was more than up for the challenge! I had never used Final Cut Pro or even filmed anything before this, so I was more than a little nervous.</p>

<p>The aim of the project was to create some instructional videos on how to make decent coffee, they had to be easy to understand and follow as the videos are aimed at anyone who has a love for coffee - not just coffee geeks. After many storyboards and lots of making coffee (for testing purposes not because I have an addiction!) we finally got down to filming. I now have a new found appreciation for all the effort and re-takes it takes to make ANYTHING...</p>

<p>Next comes the editing, now this was the really scary part. I had no idea what I was doing and after a quick tutorial from Jenna (a fellow member of the design team) I was unleashed onto the cafetiere film. It was actually lots of fun and I was engrossed in it for agggeeess. The above film is the final out come and I don't think it is bad at all - even if I do say so myself!</p>
