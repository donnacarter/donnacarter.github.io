<p class="intro">Ok so it is that time of year where England goes crazy for football, personally I could take it or leave it but I do like the cheery spirit it brings out in people.</p>

<p>I found this lego animation of the goals from England vs USA and couldn't help but smile. This video was created by <a href="http://legofussball.eu/">legofussball.eu</a> and shockingly takes around 3 hours per goal to make!</p>
