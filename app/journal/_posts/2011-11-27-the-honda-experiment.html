<p class="intro">There is a new fun online game that everyone should have a go on, even if it is just to kill some time at work!</p>

<p>The game is called The Honda Experiment, the game basically asks you to put the pop-up windows in the correct sequence. There are 6 different levels and then you can create your very own sequence to challenge your friends. The game works best in Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It is really cool how the pop-up windows interact with each other, I recommend getting the sequence wrong for some funny outcomes!</p>

<p>Go to <a href="http://www.experimentgame.com/">www.experimentgame.com</a> to play the game. Or go to <a href="http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2011/november/the-honda-experiment">www.creativereview.co.uk</a> to see the making of video.</p>
