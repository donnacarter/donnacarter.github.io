<p class="intro">If you find yourself quite bored through the summer months then why not pick up a copy of Creative Review and have a go at making your own Pinhole camera!</p>

<p>I am going to pick a copy up myself and try to make a Pinhole camera. It seems pretty impossible to me but I am sure it will keep me entertained for a while. For more information go to <a href="http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/july/make-your-own-pinolta-camera">www.creativereview.co.uk</a></p>

<p>I shall post photos up of my camera if and when I ever manage to do this!</p>
