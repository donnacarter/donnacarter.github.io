<p class="intro">I have been so engrossed with various things recently that I totally forgot to share this with you all!</p>

<p>A friend linked me to this site/magazine which is very exciting (well if you like type). Sadly I have missed out on the actual magazine, it sold out in two hours, but I think I will be buying the PDF version.</p>

<p>The site is <a href="http://8faces.com/">http://8faces.com/</a></p>

<p>The magazine features 8 leading designers who get asked the question, &ldquo;If you could only use eight typefaces for the rest of your life, which would you choose?&rdquo;. The magazine is made out to be more of a collectors item rather then a magazine.</p>
