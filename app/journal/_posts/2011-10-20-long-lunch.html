<p class="intro">Since moving to London I haven't really been going to any design events like I used to back in Leeds. I decided to change this and have booked myself to go to the Long Lunch on Tuesday evening.</p> 

<p>I am pretty excited about it, to see other designers talk about their work is really inspiring! I will be getting to see Dixon Baxi at this particular talk, they are pretty damn awesome so it should be really good. I recommend to any of you designers out there to get yourselves to this, at Â£8 it is a steal.</p>
