<p class="intro">I commute to Shoreditch every day for work and every day I walk by a new piece of graffiti, ranging from the size of a train ticket all the way to scaling the side of a building! Very impressive stuff.</p>

<p>What I have noticed in the two years I have been working in Shoreditch is that these are constantly changing, some of the work changing after just a couple of weeks. So many people must not even see some of the awesome art/graffiti that is scattered around the areaâ€¦ </p>

<p>This then gave me the idea that it would be great to create a really simple blog (I decided to use Tumblr) where I could upload photos of the graffiti I find as and when I come across it. Thus creating an online gallery of graffiti in the area throughout the year.</p>
