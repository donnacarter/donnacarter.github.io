<p class="intro">So I thought this was pretty amazing, Adobe have been creating virtual museum to showcase ground breaking digital work.</p> 

<p>The museum will be open 365 days a year 24/7! So you will be able to log onto it anytime you feel like venturing around the virtual museum. It is due to open this August so keep your eyes peeled or sign up for a membership (which I most certainly have done).</p>

<p>To find out more go to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/adobemuseum/">http://www.adobe.com/adobemuseum/</a></p>
