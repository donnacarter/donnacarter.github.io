<p>I had Helvetica on my mind today and it got me thinking about the Helvetica sunglasses you can buy from Lady Gaga's shop. This made me wonder if there were any other crazy Helvetica gifrts around, I came across this site:</p>

<p>Some of the things on there made me laugh, I would like one of the mugs even though I still feel undecided about Helvetica!</p>
