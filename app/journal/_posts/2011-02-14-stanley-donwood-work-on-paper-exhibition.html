<p class="intro">Last week I found out that one of my favourite artists of all time, is going to be putting on an exhibition at the same time I was going to be in London!</p>

<p>I couldn't be more excited. Stanley Donwood is amazing and is probably most famous for his work for that band called Radiohead (who I also love). The exhibition is called "Work on Paper" and will showcase a selection of rare print editions and original drawings on paper. I wouldn't miss this for the world!</p>
