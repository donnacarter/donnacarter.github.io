<p class="intro">
  One of the first tasks in my new job was to design the packaging for a Bubble T product range to be launched in <a href="http://www.bhs.co.uk" alt="British Home Stores">BHS</a> in time for Christmas.
</p>

<p>
  Paul - the owner and creator of <a href="http://bubbletcosmetics.com" alt="Bubble T Cosmetics">Bubble T Cosmetics</a> - already knew what he wanted the range to be: three additional new products to the Bubble T range that would include the classic fragrances and one limited edition fragrance exclusive to BHS. These products would be a shower gel bauble themed gift set, a macaroon lip balm gift set and a shower jelly gift set.
</p>

<p>
  The packaging style had been picked by Paul and he supplied me with the templates to start mocking up some designs. Bubble T is already a well established brand and already has a fun and energetic feel to it. I wanted to use this opportunity to play with the existing conventions and make some subtle improvements.
  My challenge was to take this usual brand &amp; packaging style and improve it.

<p>
  With this in mind I started working up some designs, mainly focussing on the typography and establishing this as a new range.
