<p>I thought I would post some photos of how the spot gloss looks on the business cards, it has come out amazingly well.</p>

<p>The printing company I used were amazingly helpful and very professional. I would recommend them to anyone wanting a professional print job. <a href="http://www.thelocalprintcompany.co.uk/">The Local Print Company </a></p>
