<p class="intro">I found another cool but nerdy app for my phone the other day, the app is called Printing &amp; Graphics. It is very basic and not very fantastical looking but I am finding it very useful.</p>

<p>It is basically a dictionary but specifically for printing terminology, this has been a great help for me this week because I have been dealing with printing companies a lot! I thought I had an OK knowledge when it came to printing but it turns out I still have much to learn. This week has been a fun learning experience and I have decided that I should really research more into printing techniques. Hence why this app has been so helpful to me.</p>

<p>I thought I would share this with you all just in case there a few of you out there who also have to deal with printing companies. I have attached a few screen shots for you.</p>
