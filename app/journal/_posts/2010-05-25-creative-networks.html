<p class="intro">Recently I have just started going to monthly gatherings which are full of creatives of all varieties! </p>

<p>These evenings involve gathering together for some lovely food, then a talk of some kind (the first time I went it was Harry Gration talking about Broadcasting through the ages) and then more socialising. It was so great to meet so many other creative professionals from in and around Leeds. I would recommend to anyone creative to attend these kinds of meets.</p>

<p>Here is a link to their website in case anyone is interested in going along.</p>
