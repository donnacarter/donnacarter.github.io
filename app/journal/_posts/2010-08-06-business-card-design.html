<p class="intro">So recently I have have been working on designs for some personal business cards. I have finally sent them to print I am really excited and can't wait to see the end result!</p>

<p>I have opted to go for a more expensive route and get a Spot Gloss applied to one side of the business card, the spot gloss will spell out my name on top of my favourite colour of all time to give a subtle but elegant and professional feel.</p>

<p>The printing company I decided to use are <a href="http://www.thelocalprintcompany.co.uk/">www.thelocalprintcompany.co.uk</a> they have been extremely friendly and helpful and would definitely recommend them to others seeking a printers.</p>
