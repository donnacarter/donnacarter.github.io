<p class="intro">I have my best friend Billy to thank for this interesting post, he works in Hoxton at <a href="http://www.unit9.com/">unit9</a> and recently they have had none other than <a href="http://www.jonburgerman.com/">Jon Burgerman</a> come and doodle on their windows while everyone worked!</p>

<p>I can't even begin to imagine how exciting this must have been for Billy to see, I am insanely jealous. This is a short video by Billy.</p>
