<p>I am pretty excited about my new toy.</p>

<p>I decided that for my second trip to Paris I wanted a different way to document my holiday, as much as I love the Hipstamatic app on my iPhone the photos are just not good enough quality! I have had my eyes on the Lomography cameras for a while after an impromptu visit to Urban Outfitters of all places.</p>

<p>After much research into all of the camera's I finally decided on The Diana F+ Kirameki. I took it out for a test drive last night and it was amazing. The weirdest thing is not been able to see the photo instantly! All the photos I have been taking are test shots really just to get to grips with all the controls of the camera but I am still so excited to see how the film will turn out. The camera take 120 film so it is a new and interesting format to me. I need to get the hang of it before my trip to Paris in September!</p>

<p>Photography has a whole new level of fun for me now. For more information on Lomography go to <a href="http://www.lomography.com/">www.lomography.com</a></p>
