<p class="intro">
  I never really have much use for business cards; I just really like to have them. You never know when they might come in handy I guess! I also thought it would be a fun little side project for me to distract myself with.
</p>

<p>
  My aim was to keep them simple and attractive (obviously), while trying out something that allowed me to get a bit creative. So I went and had my logo made into a stamp, bought a couple of ink pads… But what next? WELL Moo.com have a range of “<a href="http://uk.moo.com/products/luxe/business-cards.html">Luxe Business Cards</a>” which are really thick card – three times thicker to be exact - with a rich seam of colour which runs through the middle of the card. Perfect.

  Here are the results, I am super pleased with them and thoroughly enjoyed getting to play with the stamp!
