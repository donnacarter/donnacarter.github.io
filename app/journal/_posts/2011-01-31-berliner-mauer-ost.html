<p class="intro">I found this free of charge brush font the other day and thought it was really quite awesome.</p> 

<p>The font was inspired from the graffiti on the Berlin Wall (the eastern side), created by Bratislav Milenkovic, see more of his work <a href="http://www.behance.net/BratislavMilenkovic/frame">here</a>. Having been to Berlin and walked along the Berlin wall myself I found this truly inspirational. I can't wait for this to be available for download!</p>
