<p class="intro">Google are trying to make things easier when it comes to using a wider variety of fonts in web design, they have now made available a small font directory which are available for any developer to use.</p>

<p>I know this is not a new thing but what is so cool about what Google have done is that all the fonts are are free from licensing restrictions which was previously an issue. Also because the fonts are hosted on Google and that means that because there is a high chance the font will will be cached, meaning the download of the font (can be time consuming and lead to a network latency in rendering the required font) might not be necessary. So there are a couple of reasons why it is cool. I may have an experiment with it myself!</p>
