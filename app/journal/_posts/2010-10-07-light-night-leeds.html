<p>I am finding myself getting more and more excited about this coming Friday night! It is Light Night in Leeds which means there will be all sorts of things going on around the city. I am finding it really hard to choose what I would like to go and see though, I have spent ages reading through the brochure and here are a few that have caught my eye so far.</p>

<p><strong>25 / No Dead Air: Aidan Winterburn</strong><br />
<em>Broadcasting Place, Leeds Metropolitan University, LS1 3HE / 6–11pm</em><br />
A kinetic poem written and designed by Aidan Winterburn about Broadcasting Place’s history as the site of the old BBC building — a reflection on the relationship between class, technology and power — and its new role as home to the Leeds School of Contemporary Art and Graphic Design. The poem will be projected onto Broadcasting Tower, using the three skewed blocks of the tower as a canvas to illuminate the hidden histories of the site.</p>
<p><strong>30 / The Den Project</strong><br />
<em>Park Square, LS1 2NY / 5–9pm</em><br />
The Den Project will be building a temporary installation at Park Square in collaboration with children from two Leeds primary schools. In response to architectural features in the city the children will work with found, recycled, lightweight materials and light which will be built into a magical construction that visitors can get inside and explore.</p>
<p><strong>33 / Town Hall Clock Tower Tour</strong><br />
<em>The Town Hall, LS1 3AD / 5.30pm, 6.30pm, 7.30pm, 8.30pm, 9.30pm and 10.30pm</em><br />
Your chance to climb the 203 steps for an opportunity to see inside the most iconic tower on the city’s skyline, to see the movement of the clock that has marked Leeds’ time for 150 years and 80,000,000 ticks. Access to the tower is by stairs only. Limited places available. Book at Town Hall on the night.</p>
<p><strong>44 / Urban Butterflies: Daniel Townend</strong><br />
<em>A tree on Millennium Square, LS2 3AD / All night</em><br />
Daniel Townend invites you to see Leeds from a different perspective. Among the hustle and bustle of the city, his installation offers a space to reflect on the natural wonders we expel and overlook in our cities. ‘Urban Butterflies’ brings the phenomena of clustering insects to the centre of Leeds.</p>
<p><strong>36 / Light at the End of the Tunnel: Kirsty Ware</strong><br />
<em>The Town Hall, Bridewell Corridor, LS1 3AD / 5pm–1am</em><br />
One thousand glowing origami paper cranes will illuminate the prison tunnels under the Town Hall, transforming a place of desolation into a peaceful haven. You can also make and decorate an origami sailboat to take away with you as a souvenir.</p>
<p><strong>46 / The Moving Body in the City – Kaleidoscope: Rob and Matt Vale / Lumen</strong><br />
<em>Leeds Civic Hall, Millennium Square, LS1 1UR / 6–11pm</em><br />
‘The Moving Body in the City’ is a series of five new film and projection works inspired by the moving body in relation to public space. ‘Kaleidoscope’ projects images of people’s point of contact with the ground onto the side of Leeds Civic Hall. The works are connected via an artwalk through the city centre (there’ll be a printed map at each of the film locations for you to pick up).</p>
<p><strong>58 / Vending Machine: itty bitty art committee</strong><br />
<em>Leeds City Museum entrance, LS2 8BH / 5–10pm</em><br />
The itty bitty art committee wants you to look a little closer. How about looking at art in the city exhibited on a different scale? Microscopic screen prints will be on sale in Leeds City Museum through our vending machine.</p>

<p>This is just a very small selection of things available to see and do on Friday night in Leeds. I still have more to decide on! If you are out and about in Leeds on Friday I really recommend going along to this, I went last year (on my own) and had such a brilliant time. This night just goes to show that there is so much happening in Leeds every day that we don't know about, it is a chance for anyone who lives in Leeds to experience lots of hidden treasures all in one night.</p>
