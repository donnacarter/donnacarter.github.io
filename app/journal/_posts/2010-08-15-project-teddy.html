<p class="intro">I have wanted to do this for a while now and the other day I decided to get the wheels in motion. The idea originally came from a sketch I made when I was sat in the back of one of my lectures (over 3 years ago now), the image above is that very sketch...</p>

<p>I want to turn this sketch into an actual teddy, I started with creating some layouts of the bunny and splitting the parts into various templates for cutting through the material. The next step is for me to go and browse through various fabrics until I find the one I think is perfect for Project Teddy. Will keep you posted!</p>
