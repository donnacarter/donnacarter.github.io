<p>I finally got around to getting 2 more films developed! As these films were now almost a year old I actually had no idea what was going to be on them, double the surprise woo hoo... I decided to get each film processed in a different way so that I could experiment and see what effect the different processes would have.</p>

<p>I am so pleased at the results, the photos have come out really well and it looks like I have finally got the hang of using the camera too. I decided to post some of my favourites here but if you want to see the whole set they are on my flickr:Â <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/donnacarter/sets/72157631179602804/">www.flickr.com</a></p>
