<p class="intro">I saw a friend at work with this tin of Heinz tomato soup and I got very excited.</p>

<p>The label design is so cool and vintage, the type used is also very exciting. I don't think you can tell from the photos but the logo and some of the other type has a gold drop shadow! I don't think anyone else apart from me will get this excited over a tin of soup.</p>
