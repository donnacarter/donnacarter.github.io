<p class="intro">I was digging through my old hard drive this evening and found some old work of mine from uni, I thought I would just share this with you all.</p>

<p>It was a three day workshop on my course where these were produced and the idea of the workshop was to just be creative in any way you desired. Working with Simon Fox [lord clothing/ illustrator/ music promotion] and Lee Ford [image maker/ Black Convoy] was very insightful and inspirational. Here was the outcome for me.</p>
