<p class="intro">I found a book called "Get Smashed" for Â£1 in a random book shop a while ago. I finally got round to reading it this last week, it was a very quick and easy read.</p>

<p>It goes back to a time when designers were hidden in the basement of the advertisement agencies and were only allowed to do the bidding of the account managers, not much freedom to create. The book talks about how creative people back in the day break out of the tight regime and start up agencies of their own, these were the people who would go on to create some of the most amazing advertising around.</p>
