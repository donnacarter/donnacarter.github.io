<p class="intro">I was really sad the other day when I found out that Typeface was been shown in Leeds and I couldn't go because I already had plans (the Creative Network meeting).</p> 

<p>Typeface focuses on a rural Midwestern museum and print shop where international artists meet retired craftsmen and together navigate the convergence of modern design and traditional technique. This film has got me so excited! I hope soon I will be able to afford to buy the limited edition DVD. For any designers out there I would recommend you find out if there is a showing in your area and go to see it. If you want to know more about the film got to; <a href="http://typeface.kartemquin.com/">http://typeface.kartemquin.com/</a></p>

<p>Here is the trailer for it;<br />
