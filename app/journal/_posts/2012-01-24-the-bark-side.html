<p class="intro">This advert for VW is brilliant, for anyone who loves Star Wars (which surely must be everyone!) this video is a must see.</p>

<p>The ad is a trailer for the brand's forthcoming Super Bowl spot. Try and work out which dog plays which character from the film, fun fun. I can only imagine how hard it must have been to shoot this.</p>
