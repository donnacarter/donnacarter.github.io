<p class="intro">
  I love getting asked to design logos for branding projects. There is nothing more satisfying than getting a fresh sheet of paper &amp; a pen to sketch ideas for a new identity.
</p>

<p>
  When designing logos I try to really understand the brand and itâ€™s attributes so that I can capture the essence within the logo. I tend to favour simple, bold and legible logos as I find these to be more memorable, but of course it always depends on the brand.
</p>

<p>
  These are a selection of logo concepts I have developed.
