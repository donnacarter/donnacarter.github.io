<p class="intro">
  To showcase their new coffee offering Debenhams wanted a series of friendly and engaging posters. The four posters are to be used in all of their in-store cafes.

  I created simple, light hearted illustrations were used to visually represent the concepts in the text. A hand-written style font and a natural palette were used to capture an organic feel, which represents the ethical sourcing of the coffee.
