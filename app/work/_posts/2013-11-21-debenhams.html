<p class="intro">
  I was asked by the event organisers of Startup Weekend London to design their new sponsorship document, the aim of which was to encourage large technology companies to sponsor the event.
</p>

<p>
  I also designed brand assets for the event such as posters, t-shirts and web banners.
