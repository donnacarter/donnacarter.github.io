	Some text about the re-design to go here.
</p>

<p>
  After a big re-brand Coopers decided it was time to redevelop their website. My role in this project was to design, develop and produce content for the site while colloborating with a developer for the back-end programming tasks.

<p>
  The site is designed to be minimal, spacious and suited to a variety of screen sizes. Since launch the site has been featured on a number of web design galleries.
