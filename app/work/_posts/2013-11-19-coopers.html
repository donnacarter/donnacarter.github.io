<p class="intro">
	When UCC Coffee brought Coopers under their wing, they decided it would be a great idea to give them a face lift. As a former employee of Coopers I was really excited to be leading the development of the rebrand.
</p>

<p>
  The old Coopers branding felt outdated, it didn't really represent how Coopers wanted to appear as a company. The challenge was to create a new identity for Coopers that would help them be a fun, friendly and approachable company, giving them a fresh lease of life.

<p>
  Once the brand guidelines had been completed it was time to apply this to various mediums such as the new office environment, stationary, packaging, canvasâ€™ and various promotional materials.

<p>
  After the big re-brand Coopers decided it was time to redevelop their website. My role in this project was to design, develop and produce content for the site while colloborating with a developer for the back-end programming tasks.

<p>
  The site is designed to be minimal, spacious and suited to a variety of screen sizes. Since launch the site has been featured on a number of web design galleries.
