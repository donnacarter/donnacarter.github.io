<p class="intro">
	Three Sixty is a bold and adventurous range of premium coffees, all hand crafted and hand packed.
  Each coffee has itâ€™s own set of co-ordinates which can be used to find the origin of the coffee on a map.
</p>

<p>
  Three Sixty coffee was being launched in to Waitrose, so with the Three Sixty brand already established the main focus would be on the packaging.

<p>
	It was important that the co-ordinates featured on the front of the label, this is such a big selling point for the brand and helps it stand out from the crowd. With this in mind I created a simple and modern design, which used a nice bold colour palette to represent each coffee.
