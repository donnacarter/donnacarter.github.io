<p class="intro">
  The <a href="http://www.orang-utan-coffee.ch">Orang Utan Coffee Project</a> is an initiative to save the Sumatran orangutan from extinction. Money raised from the sales of the coffee is used to promote sustainable farming and preservation of the orangutans habitat, the rainforest.

<p>
  <a href="http://www.waitrose.com">Waitrose</a> chose to support this project by stocking the coffee across their stores. My brief was to use the existing brand guidelines to design the retail packaging.
