<p class="intro">
  Bubble T Cosmetics are a vibrant and quirky bath &amp; body brand. They're known for their great smelling, tea themed products that look fantastic. BHS loved the brand and had asked Bubble T to create a gift set range that could be sold in their stores in the run up to Christmas.
</p>

<p>
  A total of three gift sets would be designed, these would include the classic fragrances and one limited edition fragrance exclusive to BHS. The products would be a shower gel bauble themed gift set, a macaroon lip balm gift set and a shower jelly gift set.
</p>

<p>
  Already a well-established brand, Bubble T has a fun and energetic feel to it. I wanted to use this opportunity to play with the existing conventions and make some subtle improvements. My challenge was to take the current brand & packaging style and improve it.
</p>

<p>
  With this in mind, my designs focused on a few key improvements: Increase typographical legibility across the packaging by introducing a clearer visual hierarchy; de-cluttering the front of the packaging; improve spacing around the logo to give it more prominence.
</p>

<p>
  The range was a success and sold out in-store and online shortly after Christmas.
