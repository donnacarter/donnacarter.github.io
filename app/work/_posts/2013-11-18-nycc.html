<p class="intro">
	We were asked to submit some branding concepts for Peter Andre's new coffee shop venture, he had some very specific ideas in mind so we had the task of bringing his ideas to life. We submitted 6 concepts and mine was chosen to go forward with.
</p>

<p>
  I took the role of lead on this project and started to develop my concept further. One of the guidlines we had been set was that the logo had to embody Peters love of New York City and it's history. It also had to have a very strong mark which could stand it's ground against chain coffee shops.
</p>

<p>
  So my goal with the branding was to combine retro and modern in a way that embodies the culture of New York City. Creating a brand that was bold and modern.

<p>
	 I applied the brand to a wide variety of media including environment concepts, exterior signage, cups, sugar sticks, uniform and business cards.

<p>
  Once two of the NYCC shops were opened I was asked to design some packaging for coffee that will be going into Tescos nationwide. NYCC would be working in partnership with <a href ="http://www.peterandrefoundation.com">The Peter Andre Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org">Cancer Research UK</a>, a donation would go to these charities with every bag sold.
</p>

<p>
  I had a very strict brief, a lot of copy and limitations which came with the packaging that was to be used. It was important to work closely with both charities to make sure they were happy with the design and use of their logos. Now the coffee is now available to buy at most <a href="http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/search/default.aspx?searchBox=new+york+coffee+club&amp;newSort=true&amp;search=Search">Tescos</a> nationwide.
