<p class="intro">
  Inspired by his experiences in New York City and his love of coffee, <a href="http://peterandre.com/" target="_blank">Peter Andre</a> had decided to open a coffee shop called <a href="http://www.newyorkcoffeeclub.co.uk/" target="_blank">New York Coffee Club</a>.
  Our role was to build a brand around his concept.
</p>

<p>
  Peter was looking for a logo that both captured his influence of New York City coffee shops and could be a recognisable brand amongst the high-street coffee shops. I began by exploring various logo ideas that embraced aspects of connections to New York and Americana.
</p>

<p>
  We submitted 6 brand approaches to his team and one of mine was chosen to be developed as the final brand.
  The onechosen was a simple one that balanced retro and contemporary - with the lone star implying the American influence.
</p>

<p>
	 I applied the brand to a wide variety of media including environment concepts, exterior signage, cups, sugar sticks, uniform and business cards.

<p>
  The brand later branched into retail and I was asked to design packaging for a coffee to be stocked in <a href="http://www.tesco.com/" target="_blank">Tescos</a> nationwide.
  NYCC would be working in partnership with <a href ="http://www.peterandrefoundation.com" target="_blank">The Peter Andre Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org">Cancer Research UK</a>, a donation would go to these charities with every bag sold.

<p>
  Due to work with two seperate charities, this project had quite a strict brief and required a lot of consideration of copy.
  It was important to work closely with both charities to make sure they were happy with the design and use of their logos.
