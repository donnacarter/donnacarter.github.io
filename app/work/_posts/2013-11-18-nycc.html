<p class="intro">
	I took the role of lead on this project after the client chose my logo concept, from a choice of 6 designs, as the basis of branding for his coffee shop - oh and did I mention the client was Peter Andre?!
</p>

<p>
	My goal with the branding was to combine retro and modern in a way that embodies the culture of New York City. I applied the brand to a wide variety of media including environment concepts, exterior signage, cups, sugar sticks, uniform and business cards.
