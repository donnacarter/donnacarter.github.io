  <p class="intro">I was born in York in the summer of 1986 and grew up there under the aroma of the nearby Nestl√© chocolate factory. At school I aspired to be a scientist. That is, until I chose to study Graphic Design over Design Technology. That's when I found my occupation. Science would have to be a backup plan.</p>

  <p>I studied for a degree in Graphic Design at the University of Huddersfield. There I really broadened my knowledge and skills. I found myself inspired by the works of Bauhaus and blah blah. Another sentence will fill this space up a bit more than this bit of filler I have just typed</p>

  <p>After university I joined the Coffee Industry, working as an in-house designer. I soon found myself transitioning from a casual drinker to a coffee snob. These days my favourite brew is a nice single-origin brewed with a V60 pourover.</p>

  <p>In 2011 I moved from Yorkshire to London to join a design studio. There, I broadened my skill-set with larger projects and working with more digital design. Having moved around the city a couple of times, I have now settled in Rotherhithe where I enjoy the contrast of canals and wildlife against the backdrop of skyscrapers.</p>

  <p>Stuff about Graphic Design</p>

  <p>When I'm not working I like to keep myself busy. Currently I am in the process of renovating a flat, something about new skills. I enjoy keeping fit, I like to run and practice yoga. I enjoy visiting galleries and exhibitions, something something. I enjoy reading, my favourite author is Stephen King. Maybe food? will see how this para flows.</p>

  <p>On the internet I run a <a href="">photo blog</a> documenting the ever changing street art of Shoreditch,. I keep a <a href="#">Pinterest</a> of design inspiration. I use my <a href="#">Flickr</a> to document both my travels and experiments with <a href="#">analogue photography</a>. Occasionally I post work in progress to <a href="#">my dribbble</a>.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to get in touch with me you can <a href="#">email me</a>, <a href="#">tweet me</a>, or find me on <a href="#">Linked In.</a></p>
