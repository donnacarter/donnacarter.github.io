  <p>I am a bit of an all rounder designer really, my current role involves me working with print, web, packaging projects and more - I love how this challenges me. So enough about work, what else do I enjoy...</p>
  <p>Working in the coffee industry has turned me into a bit of a coffee fan/snob/geek/connoisseur, so one thing that I have learnt is how to make a great cup of coffee!</p>

  <p>While I am sat drinking my coffee I am probably finding my next font to buy. I have a serious love of type and probably have far too many fonts on my mac. Here are a few of the best places I get fonts from.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.hypefortype.com">www.hypefortype.com</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.youworkforthem.com">www.youworkforthem.com</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com">www.fontsquirrel.com</a></li>

  </ul>
  <p>One of my favourite possessions is my beloved Diana F+ camera which I keep loaded up with film – yes film – ready to take with me when I go somewhere interesting. You really can’t beat the excitement of getting film developed to see how your photos came out, I am slowly getting better at this, it is surprisingly hard.</p>

  <p>Travelling to work in trendy Shoreditch everyday has really opened my eyes to all the art which is around in the streets. I started <a href="http://shoreditchgraffiti.co.uk">shoreditchgraffiti.co.uk</a> to keep a diary of sorts of all the great graffiti that comes and goes.</p>
  <p>Also when I am having a rough day or I am finding something tricky, this quote really helps. It is also a really great book that everyone should read.</p>
  <p>It's not how good you are, it's how good you want to be.</p>
