  <p class="intro">I am a bit of an all rounder designer really, my current role involves me working with print, web, packaging projects and more - I love how this challenges me. So enough about work, what else do I enjoy...</p>

  <p>Working with coffee has turned me into a bit of a fan/snob/geek/connoisseur, so one thing that I have learnt is how to make a great cup of coffee!</p>

  <p>I have a love of type and probably have far too many fonts on my mac. Here are a few of the best places I get fonts from.</p>

  <p>One of my favourite possessions is my beloved Diana F+ camera which I keep loaded up with film – yes film – ready to take with me when I go somewhere interesting.</p>

  <p>I started <a href="http://shoreditchgraffiti.co.uk">shoreditchgraffiti.co.uk</a> to keep a diary of sorts of all the great graffiti that comes and goes in Shoreditch.</p>

  <p>Also when I am having a rough day, reminding myself of this really helps.</p>
